## 👩‍💻 Project

This is the challenge proposed during nlw 2021, students were challenged to make a desktop version of the virtual badge. In addition to the challenge, I decided to add:

- Badge with 3D effect.
- Zoom-in effect when hovering over the social media layout.
- Functional background with animation and mouse interaction.
