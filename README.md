# ðŸš€ Next Level Week 5: Challenge
In this version of @rocketseat's NLW5 project, students were challenged to design a desktop virtual badge based on the instructions from the mobile version of the previous project.

# ðŸ§¾ Project
Virtual desktop badge with interactive features.

P.s: To leave the project with "my face" I decided to make several changes and research on how to develop what I wanted, these are my personal changes:
* Zoom effect when selecting a social media.
* 3D effect
* Animated background
* Interactable background
